# GAN Implementation in PyTorch

This repository provides a clean and modular implementation of a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** using PyTorch. The model is designed to generate realistic images by learning the data distribution through adversarial training between a generator and a discriminator.

## üîç Features

* Customizable **generator** and **discriminator** architectures
* Support for **SSIM**, **RMI**, and **OT-based** fusion or loss functions (optional)
* Easy configuration of **training parameters**
* Includes logging, checkpoint saving, and sample image visualization
* Modular structure for rapid experimentation

You can modify the training setup (batch size, learning rate, loss functions, etc.) in the config file.
